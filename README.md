# BOOMOV

## “Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren’t used to an environment where excellence is expected.” ~ Steve Jobs





Watching movies are an integral part of our lives….
It is our duty to make the movie booking experience effortless and seamless. With the help of this project we aim to understand the industrial implementation of Coding, learn problem solving and effective collaboration with colleagues. Hence develop a Movie Ticket Booking System “BOOMOV” which allows users to book a movie in the most seamless way possible. As per the project guidelines we intend to use C as the programming language.
With the help of MOOBOO users will not only be able to book movie tickets but also enable them to pre-order their beverages. After the users are done booking their movie tickets they will be provided a token which can be further saved on their phones and will function as e-boarding pass in airports.

When it comes to BOOMOV we believe that customers always come first. Hence we will be offering free cancellation before 24 hours of the movie. Customers will be able to view their tickets as soon as their tickets are booked and the payment handshake is successful.
